When we approach NLP, AI, Language, we are interested in embeddings and specific language tasks, 'fitting tasks', in particular fitting data and finding structure. But we are also interested in the representation of knowledge which is not about fitting but generative structure. It is also interesting to consider other statistical languages - perhaps the language of genetics, and how communication systems emerge. 


We are going to process sentences and extract tuples. We can create embeddings for sentences and match sentences such as questions to other sentences quickly. We can also match things like named entity counts to see if we are talking about the same thing.
